# Awesome Rust Audio

There are many projects available in the [RustAudio](https://github.com/RustAudio) group, which also has a [Discourse](https://rust-audio.discourse.group/), and a [Discord](https://discord.gg/b3hjnGw). This is an effort to collect all the disparate projects and resources which may come in handy working with audio/music in Rust. Projects available in the [RustAudio Github group](https://github.com/RustAudio) will not be duplicated here, so have a look there too. Attempts have been made to only feature projects which have not been abandoned, i.e. with active development in the past year or so.

Pull requests welcome!
