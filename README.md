# Awesome Rust Audio

There are many projects available in the [RustAudio](https://github.com/RustAudio) group, which also has a [Discourse](https://rust-audio.discourse.group/), and a [Discord](https://discord.gg/b3hjnGw). This is an effort to collect all the disparate projects and resources which may come in handy working with audio in Rust. Projects available in the RustAudio Github group will not be duplicated here, so have a look there too.

Pull requests welcome!
